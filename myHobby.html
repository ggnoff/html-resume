<h1>My Hobby</h1>
<p>I am a big football fan, Chelsea is my favorite team. In my spare time, I will do some kick-about with my friends
    in the city. Other thing you should know about me is I am also a fighting fan. I train kun khmer which is a form of martial
    art in cambodia which is similar to kickboxing but lethal weapon like elbow is being used. I practice reguarly to defense myself
    as well as get my body fit. I also enjoy reading book and watching anime. If you are new to anime, I suggest you to watch Death Note
    as your first anime because it is a masterpeice of all anime. U will like it!</p>
